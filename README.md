# Covid-19
Analyze data sets and try to make predictions to where we could be in the future in terms of confirmed cases and fatalities

We plan to use multiple data models to better understand where in the US we might see the next spike in cases, we also hope to incorporate other data sets from different Kaggle sets that can help us answer questions such as what countries in tearms of population have had a better success to contain infections. As well as by continents where might make a comback based on climates.
